Robo Cat

We thought, why entertain your pet, when you can get a robot to do it for you? We have seen offerings from many companies and have decided that they don't quite reach the mark in terms of appearances, these offerings are often very unalive, and uninspiring. We wanted to create an offering that resembled and imitated a cat!

Robo Cat acts as a friendly cat companion for any pet left home alone. It provides an engaging experience for pets at home. The Robo Cat can use a laser pointer, drive around, and most importantly meow and shake its tail. It effectively acts as a distraction for any lonely pet.
